# Expensify

This project is for learning React and Redux. And it is a second project in the udemy class, which is The [Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)

## Learning point
* React Component: class component & functional component
* Use React-Router to design routers
* Redux: sync actions & async actions
* Redux: programming selectors
* Use Jest & Enzyme to test component and code

## Enhancement
* I use Create-React-app to bootstrape this project
* I deploy to Firebase instead of Heroku
