## Learning point
* React Component: class component & functional component
* Use React-Router to design routers
* Redux: sync actions & async actions & state selectors
* Use Jest & Enzyme to test component and code

## Enhancement
* I use Create-React-app to bootstrape this project
* I deploy to Firebase instead of Heroku
* I use css-in-js to style the components
* I use firestore as back-end of this app
